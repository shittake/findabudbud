//To-do list:

// More urgent:
// Add to the design
// Figure out how to extract information about a user (using supabase? not sure)
// Figure out if we can somehow link python code/java code/cpp code to all these code here?
// Add a button in Account.js that gives an alert to show random information everytime we press it
// Add a button in Account.js that shows our contact information
// Figure out if we can add another field in the login page to enter NUS id as well
// Figure out if there's any 'chat' function that can be linked here

// Less urgent:
// Add more fields for the different interests (now there's only brawl stars)
// Add more pages (now there's only firstpage and testpage which don't really show anything interesting)
